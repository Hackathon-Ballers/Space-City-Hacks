# Frontend Mobile Application

### Important Notes
1. Before running, point the app towards the correct, live server
2. In `App.tsx`, edit the URL so that it's pointing at the correct live server
3. If the real one is unavailable, use the fake one in `fake-pulse-api` instructions there on how to do that.

### To Run:
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start` and choose the option you want to display the app on
